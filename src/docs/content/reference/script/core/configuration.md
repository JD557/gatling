Gatling can be configured and optimized in three ways:

* with configuration files, located in `conf` directory
* with command line options
* with the `$JAVA_OPTS` environment variable

## Configuration files

### logback.xml

This file allows you to configure the log level of Gatling.
For further information, you should have a look at the [Logback Documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html).

{{< alert tip >}}
In order to log requests and responses, uncomment the dedicated loggers in the [default logging configuration file](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/blob/main/gatling-core/src/main/resources/logback.dummy).
{{< /alert >}}

### gatling.conf {#gatling-conf}

Gatling configuration is based on the great [Typesafe Config library](https://github.com/lightbend/config).

Gatling configuration files, such as the default configuration file, use the [HOCON format](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

{{< alert tip >}}
Please check [the configuration file source on GitHub](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/blob/main/gatling-core/src/main/resources/gatling-defaults.conf) for all the available configuration options.
{{< /alert >}}

Gatling uses a fallback strategy, where:

**System properties > `gatling.conf` > gatling-defaults.conf**

`gatling-defaults.conf` is shipped in the gatling-core jar and must not be tampered.

`gatling.conf` is the default name of the user defined file. It's resolved from the ClassLoader, not the filesystem, meaning it must be placed in `src/test/resources` for a maven/gradle/sbt project and in `conf` in the bundle distribution.

This file name can be changed with a System property named `gatling.conf.file`, eg `-Dgatling.conf.file=gatling-special.conf`. Again, beware it's loaded from the ClassLoader, not the filesystem, eg:

* `-Dgatling.conf.file=src/test/resource/gatling-special.conf` is incorrect
* `-Dgatling.conf.file=gatling-special.conf` where `gatling-special.conf` is placed in `src/test/resource` is correct

The bundle distribution and the maven/gradle/sbt plugins demo projects contain an easy-to-edit `gatling.conf` file with all the available properties commented with the default values.

If you want to override default values, you have two possibilities:

* change the value in `gatling.conf`.
* set a System property (the name of the property must match the [HOCON Path](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#paths-as-keys))

{{< alert warning >}}
When editing `gatling.conf`, don't forget to remove the leading `#` that comments the line, otherwise your change will be ineffective.

## Zip Bundle Command Line Options {#cli-options}

The Zip bundle can be used to start Gatling locally, or with the Enterprise cloud edition. Run the `gatling.bat` file if you run on Windows, or the `gatling.sh` file if you run on MacOS or Linux.

Gatling can be started with several options listed below:

Common options:

| Option (short)     | Option (long)                      | Description                                                                                                                                          |

## $JAVA_OPTS

Default command line options for JAVA are set in the launch scripts.
You can use the JAVA_OPTS environment variable to override those defaults, eg:

```console

```
